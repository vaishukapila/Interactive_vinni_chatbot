#**Interactive-Vinny-chatbot**

I developed an interactive AI chatbot using Streamlit and the Google Gemini API. The chatbot provides a clean, web-based interface where users can type their questions and receive intelligent responses in real time. The conversation history is stored during the session, making it feel more natural and continuous.

To make the interface engaging, I added a styled chat design with user and bot message bubbles, as well as a custom send button. The chatbot connects to the Gemini 2.0 Flash model, which generates high-quality answers to user queries.

The main goal of this project was to create a simple, user-friendly, and responsive AI assistant that demonstrates the integration of a large language model into a web app. This project can be extended further by adding voice input/output, multilingual support, or domain-specific customization.
